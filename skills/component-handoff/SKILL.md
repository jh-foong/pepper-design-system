# Component Handoff · v4

Created by **Mauro Berteri**. Builds a dev-handoff-ready documentation frame from a single selected
`COMPONENT` or `COMPONENT_SET`, in one of 3 styles (Minimal / Brutalist / Card). Output is real, editable
Figma nodes.

**Tool note (adapted for this project):** every read/write below runs through this project's `use_figma` MCP tool (Figma Plugin API access) plus `get_screenshot` — there's no separate `figma-use` companion skill to load first in this project.

## Why v4 has no external template file

v2 tried `importComponentByKeyAsync` (needs library access — breaks outside the owning account). v3 tried
reading a shared template file live via `get_metadata`/`get_design_context` on every run (no library
needed, but still needs **file-sharing** access, and — the actual reason it failed for a colleague on a
different account — Figma's MCP server caps **Starter/View/Collab seats at 6 tool calls per month**; this
skill needs 20–35 calls per run, so anyone without a Dev/Full seat on a paid plan hit the ceiling
immediately regardless of file permissions).

**v4 bakes every value directly into this file instead.** Nothing here is invented — every number, color,
and font below was verified pixel-for-pixel against the 3 original templates (`QqQiXQKzlTbJe3bPXVg2MP`,
node ids `51:2`/`51:3`/`51:4`) by building each section with `use_figma` and comparing `screenshot()`
output side-by-side against the template's own render, correcting drift until they matched. `use_figma`
only writes to the person's own file, so it isn't subject to any external-file quota — this is what makes
v4 work for literally anyone, on any Figma plan, in any organization.

**Trade-off:** if the source templates change later, this file won't know. Re-verify by hand (screenshot
diff, the same way this was built) and edit the tables below — never let an agent "re-derive" values from
a screenshot on its own; that reintroduces the exact drift this file exists to prevent.

**Banned, always:** `importComponentByKeyAsync`, `importComponentSetByKeyAsync`, reading any file other
than the one the person is working in, guessing a value not in the tables below.

## Shared structure (identical across all 3 styles)

Every style has the same **9 sections**, always in this order, always all 9 (see Step 5 for trimming rows
*inside* a section — never skip a whole section):

1. Header (component name, description, owner/library/version)
2. Preview
3. Variant Grid — one row per relevant type/variant axis, with the S·Light/M·Light/S·Dark/M·Dark (or
   equivalent) combos per row. **Column count per row is not fixed** — see the cell-sizing rule below;
   the reference Button happens to fit 4 across, a wider component will fit fewer.
4. Do's and Don'ts — 3 Do examples, 3 Don't examples
5. Interaction States — one cell per state that actually exists on the component (6 for the reference
   Button: `Enabled`, `Hover`, `Pressed`, `Focus`, `Loading`, `Disabled`). **Column count per row is not
   fixed** either, same rule.
6. Anatomy
7. Agentic Documentation
8. Code & MCP

## Font-role rule (applies to every style)

Two roles only. Get this right and every typography value below follows automatically:

- **Title role** — hero title, section titles (Preview/Variant Grid/Do's and Don'ts/etc.), variant-grid
  row-group labels (`Accent`/`Primary`/...), and Do/Don't example card titles. Uses the **style's title
  font** (table below). This is a deliberate normalization: the original Minimal template's own row-group
  labels used IBM Plex Sans in the source file (a template inconsistency), overridden here to Inter per an
  explicit design-owner correction so Minimal is internally consistent (title role = Inter everywhere,
  since Inter *is* Minimal's title font).
- **Body role** — everything else: descriptions, metadata pill/box text, captions (`S · Light`, state
  names), do/don't body copy, anatomy property rows, agentic doc, code & mcp, copyright. **Always Inter**,
  in all 3 styles, no exceptions. **Never Roboto Mono**, even though the original template's agentic-doc
  text node uses it — this was an explicit design-owner override.
- **One more named exception, body role, all styles:** the component name shown *inside* Anatomy (`Button`)
  is Inter SemiBold 24px regardless of style — unlike the hero title, it does not switch to the style's
  title font.
- **One more named exception, title role, all styles:** the **version value** (`v1.0` / `V.1.0.0`) uses the
  style's title font, not Inter — even though Owner/Library values next to it stay Inter.

| Style | Title font | Weight names used |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|
| Minimal (modo-1) | Inter | Bold (hero), Semi Bold (everything else title-role) |
| Brutalist (modo-2) | IBM Plex Sans | Medium (hero), SemiBold (everything else title-role) |
| Card (modo-3) | Geist | Medium (hero, section titles), SemiBold (row labels, do/dont card titles) |

## Default sizing rule — HUG unless a fixed number is written down here

**A wrapper frame with no explicit width/height documented in this file must be `layoutSizingHorizontal:
'HUG'` and `layoutSizingVertical: 'HUG'` on whichever axis isn't otherwise constrained.** This wasn't
stated before and, without it, the agent building a section invents a plausible-looking fixed number for
any wrapper this file doesn't explicitly size — which happened identically across all 3 styles: the
`Cells · {type}` row wrapper (Variant Grid) and the per-state description text wrapper (Interaction
States, e.g. `Enabled Desc`) both got hardcoded to a fixed `100px` height that appears nowhere in this
file, cutting off taller content (an Error-state cell that's naturally 176px tall inside a row fixed at
100) or leaving dead space for shorter content.

Two wrappers this affects by name, to close the exact bug that already happened:

- **`Cells · {type}` (Variant Grid row wrapper):** `layoutSizingVertical: 'HUG'`. Cells in the same row can
  have different heights (an Error/expanded variant is taller than a plain Filled one) — the row must grow
  to whichever cell is tallest, never be fixed at any specific number.
- **`{State} Desc` (Interaction States description wrapper):** `layoutSizingVertical: 'HUG'`, sized to
  however many lines the actual description text needs — never a fixed height regardless of copy length.

If a container's size genuinely needs to be fixed, it's already written down explicitly elsewhere in this
file (variant/state cell padding, Do/Don't card behavior, root/body padding, etc.) — if you can't find a
number for it here, the answer is HUG, not a number you make up to look plausible.

**`cornerRadius: 16` applies to every card/container box in this system, in all 3 styles**, unless the
table below says otherwise for that specific element:

- Preview container, Anatomy container, Agentic Documentation container, Code & MCP container
- Every variant-grid cell, every interaction-state cell
- Do/Don't example cards (already noted below, restated here for completeness)

**Exceptions** (don't apply 16 to these): buttons and pills use `cornerRadius: 1000` (fully round — see
`BUTTON.cornerRadius` and the version/Documentation pills). The root frame itself uses `cornerRadius: 0`
in Minimal and Brutalist, `48` in Card (see "Root fill" row below). Check/X circles use `cornerRadius`
equal to half their own size (12, for a 24×24 circle) — or just use `figma.createEllipse()`.

**Every container that has both a `cornerRadius` and an absolute-positioned child sitting flush against
its edge (variant-grid cells, state cells — see the caption/label pattern below) needs `clipsContent =
true` set explicitly.** This is not the Plugin API default for programmatically created frames. Without
it, a caption/label box with square corners sits flush against a rounded cell and its corners visibly
poke out past the cell's rounded edge — the source template avoids this because its container clips
content by default; a frame built with `figma.createAutoLayout`/`figma.createFrame` does not, unless you
set it yourself:

```js
cell.clipsContent = true;
```

## Per-style structural spec

Read this table alongside `CONTENT` and `COLOR` above — it's the only place style-specific numbers live.

**Brutalist header bar, spelled out (this was under-specified before and got built wrong — Documentation
ended up alone, left-aligned, with no System Name Box at all):** the header bar is 3 items in one 70px-tall
horizontal row, `#f5f0e9` fill + 0.5px `#1a1e1b` stroke, sharing the row's full width:

1. `System Name Box` — HUG width, pad 0/24, text `CONTENT.systemName`, left edge of the row.
2. A `FILL`-sized spacer between them (empty, no content) — this is what pushes item 3 to the far right.
3. `Documentation Box` — HUG width, pad 0/24, `CONTENT.` text `"Documentation"` + the arrow icon, **flush
   to the right edge of the row**, never left-aligned.

`Component Details` (Owner/Library/Version, the second bar at the bottom of the header) is separate from
this — don't merge Documentation into it, and don't drop the System Name Box to save a step.

| Property | Minimal (M1) | Brutalist (M2) | Card (M3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Root width | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 |
| Root fill | white | **`#f5f0e9` on the entire root frame — header AND body, the whole page background, not just the header sub-pieces** | white, `cornerRadius: 48` |
| Root padding | 64 all sides | top 0 / sides 0 / bottom 64 | top 24 / sides 24 / bottom 64 |
| Header-to-body gap | n/a — Minimal has no separate `Body` wrapper at all; every section (header included) is a direct sibling in one flat stack with `itemSpacing: 64` between all of them | **64** — `Container` (header) and `Preview Section` (body-equivalent) are direct siblings of the root, `itemSpacing: 64` between them | **48** — verified against source (`OgCpdTFA2rbOJlVQ5Ec9nR`, node `3:97`): `Component Info` ends at y=488, `Body` starts at y=536. This was never written down before and the agent building it either nested `Component Info` inside `Body` or guessed a different gap, both wrong — `Component Info` and `Body` must be **direct sibling children of the root**, never one nested inside the other, with `itemSpacing: 48` between them |
| Body inner padding (beyond root) | — (root padding is the only inset) | **sides 64** (verified against source — do not assume this matches Card's 48; each style's own padding was independently wrong twice during development from copy-pasting between styles instead of checking the source per style) | sides 48 |
| Content width | 1072 | 1072 | 1056 |
| Header shell | `Component Info` autolayout, gap 24, no fill, no border | See "Brutalist header bar" note below | `Component Info` card, `#d0b6ff` fill, `cornerRadius 32`, pad 48, gap 81 |
| Hero title size/color | 64px `#1c1c1f` | 81px `#1a1e1b` | 81px `#54299b` |
| Hero desc size/lh/color | 16px / 150% / `#8c8c8c` | 24px / 140% / `#1a1e1b` | 24px / 140% / `#1a1e1b` |
| Section title size/color | 40px `#1c1c1f` | 48px `#1a1e1b` | 48px `#54299b` |
| Section desc size/lh | 20px / 140% `#1a1e1b` (all styles, unchanged) |
| Owner/Library value font | Inter **Regular** 20px | Inter **Medium** 20px | Inter **Medium** 20px |
| Version value | pill, `#00b894` fill, `cornerRadius 100`, pad 6/14, Inter SemiBold 16px white, text `v1.0` | box, pad 0/24, height 70, HUG width, title-font SemiBold 20px, text `V.1.0.0` | pill, white fill, `cornerRadius 80`, pad 16/24, Geist SemiBold 20px, text `V.1.0.0` |
| Metadata layout | `Header Top` (title+version) then `Component Details` row, gap 24 | `Owner Container` FILL spacer + `Owner`/`Library`/`Version` HUG boxes, no gap (borders touch) | `Component Details` row `justify-between`: pills wrap (Owner/Version/Library) vs. Documentation pill |
| Documentation button | *none* | box in header bar, pad 0/24, Inter Medium 20px `#1a1e1b`, arrow 32×32 dark stroke | pill, `#54299b` fill, `cornerRadius 80`, pad 16/24, gap 10, Inter Medium 20px white, arrow 32×32 white stroke |
| Preview/Anatomy/Agentic/Code&MCP container fill | `#f2f2f5` (Preview) / `#f4f4f4` (others) | white + 0.5px `#1a1e1b` stroke | `#f4f4f4` |
| Preview padding | 80 all sides | 81 all sides | 81 all sides |
| Preview internal structure | `Preview Label` title, then `Preview` container (cornerRadius 16, fill per row above) holding the button instance centered, then **exactly one** `previewCaption` text directly below the button, inside the same container. Do not add a second caption anywhere in this section — `CONTENT.previewCaption` is written once. |
## Cell sizing rule — must scale with the real component, never with the reference numbers

**This was never tested against a component wider than the ~65–98px reference Button used to build this
skill, and it breaks on anything wider.** A 320px-wide component (a phone input, a search bar, a table
row) placed inside a cell sized for the reference Button overflows the cell and bleeds into the neighbors.

The `4 columns` (Variant Grid) and `3 columns` (Interaction States) counts, and any specific cell-width
pixel value implied elsewhere in this file, are **illustrative reference values for the demo Button only.**
For every real build:

1. Read the actual rendered width/height of the selected component's largest relevant variant
   (`instance.width`/`instance.height` after `createInstance()`, before placing it — check the widest
   variant that will appear in the grid, since Error/expanded states can be taller or wider than Enabled).
2. Compute `cellWidth = componentWidth + 2 * cellPadding` (24px padding each side, per the padding rule
   above), with a **sensible floor** around 200px so very narrow components (icons, small badges) don't
   produce cramped cells.
3. Set the row wrapper (`Cells · {type}` in Variant Grid, each `States Row` in Interaction States) to
   `layoutWrap: 'WRAP'` and give each cell a fixed width via `cellWidth` above (not `layoutSizingHorizontal:
   'FILL'`, which is what silently produced the 4-and-3-column reference counts in the first place — FILL
   divides the row's total width evenly by a column count baked in from the reference build, instead of
   sizing to content). With `WRAP`, however many columns actually fit at `cellWidth` will fit per row, and
   the rest flow to additional rows automatically — this replaces "4 across" / "3 across" as a fixed
   assumption with "however many actually fit," which is correct for both a narrow icon and a wide input.
4. Never assume a column count when writing the build code — derive it, or let `WRAP` derive it for you.

| Variant cell padding (all 4 sides) | **24** (not the template's original 81/113 — explicit design-owner correction, applies to all 3 styles) |
| Variant cell light bg | `#f2f2f5` | white + 0.5px `#1a1e1b` stroke | `#f4f4f4` |
| Variant cell dark bg | `#2e2e33` | `#1a1e1b` | `#1d1a1e` |
| Variant caption box | **absolute overlay, flush bottom** (`x:0, y: cell.height-32, width: cell.width, height: 32`), no fill/border, text **centered**, 20px inset from the very bottom edge in M1 specifically (`y: cell.height - 32 - 20`... i.e. positioned 20px above the flush edge) | absolute overlay flush bottom (0/-0.5px offsets), `#f5f0e9` fill + 0.5px `#1a1e1b` stroke, text centered | absolute overlay flush bottom, **no fill/border**, text **right-aligned**, pad-right 16 |
| Do/Don't card | white fill, 0.5px stroke (`doStroke`/`dontStroke`), `cornerRadius 16`, pad 24, gap 24. **Use `layoutSizingVertical: 'HUG'`, not a fixed height** — the reference build's 195px only happened to fit because every reference title was one line; a real component's title can wrap to 2 lines and a fixed height then crowds the description against it. Let the card grow to fit its own content instead. **If a Do/Don't example embeds a component instance and the component is wider than the card, apply the same cell-sizing rule** (widen the card or drop to fewer cards per row via `WRAP`) rather than letting the instance overflow. If the instance genuinely doesn't fit two per row at a readable size, it's fine for a Do/Don't card to skip the instance and use icon+title+description only, same as the reference build already does when appropriate. |
| States cell bg | `#f2f2f5` | white + 0.5px `#1a1e1b` stroke | `#f4f4f4` |
| States label box | absolute overlay flush bottom, `#e1e1e1`-ish neutral fill(*), text centered | absolute overlay flush bottom, `#f5f0e9` fill + 0.5px stroke, text centered | absolute overlay flush bottom, **no fill/border**, text **centered** (unlike this style's own variant-grid captions, which are right-aligned — verify independently, don't assume one inherited the other) |
| Row-group / Do-Don't-card title font | Inter SemiBold 24px / 18px | IBM Plex Sans SemiBold 24px / 18px | Geist SemiBold 24px / 18px |

(*) M1 states label fill was not re-verified as precisely as the rest of this table — confirm against a
fresh screenshot compare before treating it as final if a discrepancy shows up.

Check/X glyphs go inside a 24×24 solid-color circle (`checkGreen`/`xRed`), white glyph, `figma.createNode
FromSvg`, `resize(16,16)`, `layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'` **then** `x = 4, y = 4` (see gotcha 2 below).
**A bare `figma.createEllipse()` with no vector child is not a valid Do/Don't icon — it happened once during
development and shipped as a plain colored dot with nothing inside.** The `figma.createNodeFromSvg(...)`
call for the check/X path is not optional decoration, it's the icon; don't skip it even when the rest of
the card (icon + title, no instance) is otherwise simple to build.
Arrow (M2/M3 only, M1 has no Documentation button) recolors per its own button background: dark
(`#1a1e1b`) on M2's light box, white on M3's solid purple pill.

## Plugin API gotchas (read before Step 2 — these caused real bugs during development)

**1. Absolute overlays must be resized/positioned AFTER the parent row's width has settled, not at
creation time.** If cell 1 of a row gets its absolute label box `resize()`d using `cell.width` immediately,
before cells 2–4 exist, that width can be stale once the row's final layout resolves — producing a
too-narrow or too-wide label on exactly the cells built first. Fix: build every cell in the row, collect
`{ cell, labelBox }` pairs, then in a **second pass** after all of them exist:

```js
for (const { cell, labelBox } of pendingLabels) {
  labelBox.resize(cell.width, 32);
  labelBox.x = 0;
  labelBox.y = cell.height - 32;
}
```

**2. `layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'` must be set BEFORE `x`/`y`**, or auto layout keeps controlling the
node's position and silently ignores the coordinates:

```js
child.layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'; // first
child.x = 4; child.y = 4;             // then
```

**3. Padding at every level of the root→body→section chain must match the table above exactly** — a single
wrong padding value (e.g. body padding 24 instead of Card's 48) makes `layoutSizingHorizontal: 'FILL'`
stretch every section wider than it was built for, which then breaks any absolute overlay sized in a
previous step (gotcha 1) even though nothing about that section itself was touched. If a caption/label
looks subtly wrong after assembly, check padding up the chain before touching the section's own code.

## Step 0 — Discovery (2 questions)

**Tool note (adapted for this project):** ask these with the `AskUserQuestion` tool (this project has no separate widget/`show_widget` mechanism for this) — one call per question below, each a genuine judgment call the person should make, not something to infer.

| Question | Options | What the answer sets |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| **1 — Style** | Minimal / Brutalist / Card, each option's description pulled from the structural spec above (hero font, container treatment) | Which per-style structural spec row to build from (`Style: modo-1` etc.) |
| **2 — Metadata** | Ask Version, Owner (offer "Me" plus free text), Library name, and Description handling (Keep/Trim/Replace) as separate questions or one multi-part ask, whichever `AskUserQuestion` renders best | `Version: 1.0 · Owner: me · Library: Acme DS · Description: keep` |

Skip the Language question from earlier versions of this skill — this project's audience is English-only; write all label/section text in English, always.

**Resolving "Me" for Owner:** run `return figma.currentUser` in the first `use_figma` call and use `.name`.
That real name — never the literal word "Owner"/"Propietario" — is what gets written into the owner field.
If the person typed a name instead, use exactly what they typed.

Never present per-section checkboxes — all 9 sections build every time; trimming (Step 5) is automatic.

## Step 1 — Inspect the selection

Read `componentPropertyDefinitions`, variants, and `description` off the selected `COMPONENT`/
`COMPONENT_SET` in the person's own file (this is a normal local read, not an external-file call — no
quota concern). Generate the MCP link:

```
https://www.figma.com/design/{fileKey}/{fileName}?node-id={nodeId with : replaced by -}
```

## Step 2 — Build section by section (one `use_figma` call per section)

For each of the 9 sections, in order — Header → Preview → Variant Grid → Do's and Don'ts → Interaction
States → Anatomy → Agentic Documentation → Code & MCP → Copyright — write the section using only `CONTENT`,
`COLOR`, the structural-spec row for the chosen style, `BUTTON`, `TYPE`, and `ICONS` above. Use
`figma.createAutoLayout` for any container with related children. Populate placeholder text now (`Label`,
`Component name`) — Step 3 swaps in real content. Call `get_screenshot` on the frame at the end of each call and
compare mentally against the structural-spec description for that section before moving on; don't
accumulate 9 sections on top of one that's already wrong.

Don't batch more than ~10 logical operations per `use_figma` call — this maps naturally to
one section per call, sometimes two calls for Variant Grid (5 rows × 4 cells) and Do's and Don'ts (6
cards).

## Step 3 — Populate real content (AI's only job)

The AI fills **content**, never **layout** — every geometry value already came from the tables above.

- Swap `Label` placeholders inside variant/state/do's-donts button instances with the real component's
  variants (`variant.createInstance()`), matched by the closest available prop combination.
- Header: real component name, version, library, description (per Step 0 answers), owner resolved per the
  note above.
- Variant grid: real variant names as row labels; captions reflect actual size/background combos that
  exist on the component (trim per Step 4 when an axis doesn't exist).
- Do's/Don'ts: generate 2–3 plausible pairs from the component's actual props if no design-system guidance
  exists; mark them as suggestions, not validated rules.
- Interaction states: read `reactions` if present; otherwise map existing state variants. Note (don't
  invent) any standard state the component is missing.
- Anatomy: real `componentPropertyDefinitions`, variant count, nested component names.
- Agentic Documentation: real markdown — component name, real props table, real Do's/Don'ts, accessibility
  notes inferred from the component type. Font stays Inter regardless (see font-role rule).
- Code & MCP: the real MCP link from Step 1. `—` for any field left empty in Step 0.

## Step 4 — Auto-trim (no user picker)

Trim rows/cells whose axis doesn't exist on the real component (e.g. no dark-background variant, no state
variants at all) — never remove a whole section; all 9 always build.

## Step 5 — Final QA (mandatory)

- `get_screenshot` every major section and compare it against the structural-spec description for that
  style/section above.
- Confirm: no Roboto Mono anywhere; title font matches the style; every absolute caption/label box has the
  correct fill/alignment for its style *and* section (variant grid vs. states grid can differ within the
  same style — don't assume one inherited the other); every wrapper has explicit `layoutSizing*` set after
  its children were appended; all created/mutated node IDs are returned.
- Name the root `[Component name] · Handoff`.

## Self-check before finishing

- [ ] No external file was read. Every value came from this file's tables, `figma.currentUser`, or the
      person's own selected component.
- [ ] No `importComponentByKeyAsync`/`importComponentSetByKeyAsync` anywhere.
- [ ] No Roboto Mono; title font matches the style (font-role rule, including both named exceptions);
      body/labels are Inter everywhere.
- [ ] Every absolute-positioned caption/label box was resized/positioned in a second pass, after all
      sibling cells in its row were created (gotcha 1) — not at creation time.
- [ ] Every `layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'` assignment happened before its `x`/`y` assignment (gotcha 2).
- [ ] Padding at every level of the root → body → section chain matches the structural-spec table exactly
      for the chosen style (gotcha 3) — Card's body padding is 48, not 24; don't copy Brutalist's number.
- [ ] Variant-grid cell padding is 24 all sides in every style (explicit correction, not the template
      original 81/113).
- [ ] Icons (check/close/arrow) are real vector paths from `ICONS`, not empty placeholder frames.
- [ ] Owner field shows an actual name (`figma.currentUser.name` or what the person typed) — never the
      literal word "Owner"/"Propietario".
- [ ] All 9 sections present; trimmed rows/cells only where the component's real data doesn't support them.
- [ ] Every container (Preview, Anatomy, Agentic Doc, Code&MCP, variant cells, state cells, Do/Don't cards)
      has `cornerRadius: 16` — none of them left sharp-cornered by default.
- [ ] Brutalist's root fill (`#f5f0e9`) was applied to the whole root frame, not only the header pieces.
- [ ] Body/content padding matches the structural-spec table **per style** exactly (Minimal 64 on root
      directly, Brutalist 64 inside the body, Card 48 inside the body) — never copy one style's padding
      number into another without checking this table first; this exact mistake happened twice with
      Brutalist alone during development.
- [ ] Every variant-grid cell and state cell has `clipsContent = true` set explicitly, so the flush-bottom
      caption/label box's square corners don't poke out past the cell's rounded corners.
- [ ] Variant-grid and interaction-states cell widths were computed from the **real selected component's**
      rendered width (plus padding), not copied from the reference Button's 256px/341px numbers — checked
      by actually reading `instance.width` after creating it, not assumed. Row wrappers use `layoutWrap:
      'WRAP'` so column count adapts instead of being fixed at 4 or 3.
- [ ] Card style (Modo 3): `Component Info` and `Body` are direct sibling children of the root — never one
      nested inside the other — with exactly `itemSpacing: 48` between them. Don't reuse Brutalist's 64.
- [ ] Brutalist header bar has all 3 pieces (System Name Box, spacer, Documentation Box) with Documentation
      flush right — never just Documentation alone or left-aligned.
- [ ] Every check/X icon is a real inserted vector glyph — never a bare `figma.createEllipse()` with
      nothing inside it.
- [ ] Do/Don't cards use `layoutSizingVertical: 'HUG'`, not a fixed height — checked with a component whose
      real title is long enough to wrap to 2 lines, not just the single-line reference copy.
- [ ] Every wrapper without an explicit fixed size documented in this file is `HUG` on both axes — in
      particular `Cells · {type}` row wrappers and `{State} Desc` text wrappers, which both got wrongly
      hardcoded to 100px once already. No fixed number was invented for anything this file doesn't specify.
